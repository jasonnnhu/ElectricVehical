    "text": "1 Introduction\n1.1 The Rising Significance of Electric Vehicles Our choice to focus on “Electric Vehicle Population Data” is driven by the pivotal role electric vehicles (EVs) play in our journey towards a more sustainable future. In the face of escalating climate change concerns, EVs emerge not just as technological marvels but as beacons of environmental hope. They signify a major transition in both automotive technology and consumer behavior, bearing direct consequences for environmental policies, urban development, and the global energy landscape. This project, therefore, not only aligns with current technological trends but also resonates with urgent environmental imperatives.\n1.2 Exploratory Avenues and Key Questions Our project is rooted in a set of compelling questions that seek to unravel the dynamics of EV adoption. First, it aims to chart the evolution of electric vehicle popularity over recent years, probing into the trajectory of their adoption. A geographical lens will then be applied to discern regional patterns in EV uptake, a line of inquiry that reveals the socio-economic and policy-driven nuances influencing electric vehicle prevalence. Additionally, by dissecting the dataset to understand the popularity hierarchy among different types of EVs - hybrids, plug-ins, and fully electric models - the project aims to offer insights into consumer preferences and market trends. These explorations are essential for stakeholders ranging from policymakers to automotive industry players, providing them with data-driven insights to steer future strategies.\n1.3 Contexts for Unfamiliar Readers For those less familiar with the domain, electric vehicles represent a class of automobiles that are powered entirely or partially by electricity, diverging from the traditional reliance on gasoline or diesel engines. This shift is pivotal in the context of reducing emissions that contribute to global warming and deteriorating air quality. Understanding the patterns and proliferation of EVs is not just a topic of academic interest but a window into understanding how technological adoption can drive significant environmental change."

This graph provides a clear indication of which columns have missing data and the extent of these missing values.\nPercentage of Missing Values: The second graph shows the percentage of missing values relative to the total number of rows in the dataset for each column with missing data. This perspective is crucial for understanding the significance of the missing data in relation to the entire dataset."
